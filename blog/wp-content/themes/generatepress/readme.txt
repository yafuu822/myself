== Description ==

GeneratePress is a fast, lightweight (less than 1MB zipped), mobile responsive WordPress theme built with speed, SEO and usability in mind. 

GP can serve as a solid base for any website, and works great with any of your favorite page builders. 

With an emphasis on WordPress coding standards, we ensure GeneratePress is compatible with all well-coded plugins, including major ones like WooCommerce, WPML, BuddyPress and bbPress. 

GeneratePress is device friendly (mobile and tablet), uses 100% valid HTML, is fully schema microdata integrated, is translated into over 20 languages by our amazing community and is cross browser compatible (including IE8). 

Some of our features include 9 widget areas, 5 navigation positions, 5 sidebar layouts, dropdown menus (click or hover) and a back to top button. 

All our options use the native WordPress Customizer, meaning you can see every change you make instantly before pressing the publish button.
